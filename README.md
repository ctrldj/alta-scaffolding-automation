 # ALTA Scaffolding Automation Suite

 ## Overview

 ALTA Scaffolding is a family-run Australian small business providing scaffolding services locally. This repository contains the code, apps, and automations we are building to:
 
 - Streamline and automate back-of-house processes
 - Reduce operational costs
 - Improve efficiency and accuracy
 - Provide transparency and reporting

 Since we don't have an internal IT department or strong coding background, this repo serves as our centralized workspace to:

 - Collaborate with our AI assistant (ChatGPT) to develop and maintain our software tools
 - Document our processes, scripts, and applications
 - Track progress and changes over time

 ## Why This Repo Exists

 - We need to digitize processes currently managed with manual spreadsheets and paperwork.
 - Automations help reduce errors, save time, and free up staff to focus on core business activities.
 - A centralized codebase ensures organization, version control, and knowledge sharing.
 - We leverage AI guidance to build and maintain reliable, easy-to-use tools.

 ## Repository Structure

 ```text

 ├── README.md       # This file
 ├── apps/           # Individual applications (e.g., quoting tool, inventory tracker)

 ```

 The structure may evolve as we add and refine tools.

 ## Getting Started

 1. Install prerequisites:
    - Python 3.x (for scripts and apps written in Python)
    - Node.js (if any Node-based tools are used)
 2. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/alta-scaffolding-automation.git
    cd alta-scaffolding-automation
    ```
 3. Explore the `apps/`, `scripts/`, and `docs/` folders for more details and individual README files.

 ## Working with ChatGPT

 We rely on our AI assistant for:
 - Generating code snippets
 - Explaining technical concepts in simple, step-by-step terms
 - Guiding setup, configuration, and deployment

 Ask questions in plain English; explanations will be provided as if you were five years old.
